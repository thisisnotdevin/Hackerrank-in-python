Python is a fantastic language to learn for coding interviews. Thats why I'm using Hackerrank's platform to practice on. Solving these problems with Python will teach me how to use python and help me sharpen my skills. Plus, these problems can be approached in different ways, using python can be so much easier and simpler than Java or Javascript, which will broaden your understanding of algorithms and data structures.
